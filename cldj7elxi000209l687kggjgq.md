As a web developer, I have come across several projects that require me to optimize the SEO of a website. One of the ways to do this is by including the right meta tags in a website's HTML code. To make my work easier, I decided to create a boilerplate for the most commonly used meta tags for SEO optimization.

This boilerplate is designed to include all the essential elements you need to get your website off the ground and running smoothly. From character encoding and viewport configuration to meta tags and schema markup, I've got you covered.

One of the highlights of this boilerplate is its focus on search engine optimization (SEO). I've included meta tags to specify the page title, description, and keywords, as well as open graph and Twitter card metadata to ensure your website looks great when shared on social media. I've also included a script to provide structured data in the form of a JSON-LD schema, which helps search engines better understand the content on your website.

Another handy feature of this boilerplate is the `<link>` tag for alternate language versions of your page. This allows you to specify a different URL for the same content in other languages, making it easier for users and search engines to access the content that's most relevant to them.
