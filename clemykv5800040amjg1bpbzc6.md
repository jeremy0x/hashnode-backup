# My Experience with Sentinel Finance: A Frustrating Outcome

### Introduction

Working as a freelancer in the tech industry can be exciting and rewarding, but it can also be challenging. In this blog post, I, the author, want to share my experience of working with a team on a project called Sentinel Finance, which ultimately got shut down, and how I was left unpaid for my work. As of the time of writing this blog post on February 27, 2023, this is my first and only experience working as a freelancer.

### The Project

Sentinel Finance's digital platform, SentFI, aimed to protect web3 users from scams and offer services such as loans, commerce, NFT insurance, and anti-rug pull (more info at [sentfi.githbook.io/sentinel](http://sentfi.githbook.io/sentinel)). I was hired as a front-end developer on a freelance basis for a 3-month contract (September to November 2022) to help develop the user interface. I was recommended for the project by a backend developer whom I had worked with on a training conducted by Zuri Team ([training.zuri.team](http://training.zuri.team)) a few months earlier. When the project needed a front-end developer, the back-end developer pitched the opportunity to me and I accepted after meeting with the product manager.

Initially, I was hired on a three-month contract basis, but unfortunately, the project was shut down after only two months and I never received any official explanation for the sudden shutdown. I'm glad that I declined payment by equity, as that would have resulted in an even greater loss than not receiving payment for the second month of my work with them.

The team was made up of experienced professionals, and everyone was excited about the project. However, there was no organization in the project, and we faced various challenges. The project manager did not respond to questions on time, and there were no consistent team meetings. We used a WhatsApp group to communicate, which can be difficult to track messages compared to Slack, where you can create threads.

My first challenge as the front-end developer was that the designer was slow to deliver designs, likely because the product manager and the designer were constantly making changes. This led to a delayed start to my work as the front-end developer.

Eventually, the homepage was completed and I began working on it. I deployed the homepage to [sentfi.xyz](http://sentfi.xyz) myself on Netlify, as the team did not hire a DevOps engineer to handle that.

However, since the backend was not yet completed for the other parts of the website, I was only able to deploy the parts that I had finished working on. These parts were only the front-end, so I decided to deploy them as a personal project to &lt;[sentfi.netlify.app](http://sentfi.netlify.app)\&gt;, knowing that the project was shutting down and I wouldn't be able to finish the work I had started.

### The Shutdown

After working on the Sentinel Finance project for two months, I stopped hearing from the product manager. While disappointing, I understood that such things can happen in the startup world.

The last time I heard from him was when he informed me that he had been asked to focus on another project called CredSola, but he assured me that he would process my second month's payment. However, after not hearing back from him for a while, I sent a follow-up text asking about the payment and suggested we schedule a meeting to discuss the next move. Unfortunately, he never replied to my message and I eventually stopped texting him.

I also contacted the backend developer who had recommended me for the project, and he had the same experience - he stopped hearing from the product manager.

### Conclusion

Working on Sentinel Finance was a great experience, and I was proud of the work I did. However, the project's shutdown and the lack of payment for my second month of work left a sour taste in my mouth.

As a freelancer, it's essential to work with an organized team and communicate effectively. I learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will be more cautious when working on future projects.
