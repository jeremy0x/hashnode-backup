# My Experience with creating a visually appealing website with basic technologies

## Introduction

This is my first post on [hashnode](https://hashnode.com), I'm excited to be part of this community and share my experience as a front-end developer.

As a front-end developer, I find excitement in crafting visually captivating websites using minimal tools such as pure CSS and JavaScript, without relying heavily on external libraries.

In this article, I will be sharing my experience in creating a frontend-only web application that showcases the beauty that can be achieved through simplicity in technology.

## The Project

The project I worked on is called Sentinel Finance (SentFi), and it can be found at [sentfi.netlify.app](http://sentfi.netlify.app).  
The goal of this project was to create a visually impressive web experience that would amaze users, all while utilizing only basic CSS and JavaScript, and limiting the use of external libraries.

## The Technologies

For this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the main technologies. I also made use of some small libraries for functionalities that required more complexity than I could achieve with Vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

I used Vanilla CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. I also made use of modern CSS features such as Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## The Challenges

Creating a visually stunning web experience without the use of complex frameworks or libraries was not without its challenges.

One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the design was responsive and looked good on all screen sizes, including larger screens (2000+px). I had to carefully plan the layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid and test it on different devices to ensure it looked good on all of them.

The most challenging task was probably creating pages with sidebars that were also responsive.

Another challenge was learning how to implement certain functionalities (like the modal in the image below) as I worked on the project. This required me to quickly learn new techniques and methods, but I believe this is an important trait for a developer to have.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project was a great learning experience for me. It showed me that it's possible to create a visually stunning web experience using only basic technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. It was also a great challenge and pushed me to think outside the box and get creative with the use of these technologies.
